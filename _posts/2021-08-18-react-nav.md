React Single Page Applications (SPAs) are great! But they do create a problem when you refresh a page on a path that's
different from the originating page or when you link directly to such a path. Let's talk about why that is and how we
can fix it.

### The Problem With Single Page Applications (SPAs)

Single Page Applications or SPAs, as the name would suggest, are web applications that are really just a single page. 
A JavaScript framework (e.g., React) is used to change the presentation and perform different actions based on the 
context in which the page is being used. React SPAs are great in that they can be developed by breaking the different
elements down into reusable components, which are tied together to form an application that behaves like a multi-page application.
Only, SPAs are more responsive that a traditional website composed of different HTML files served up by making independent requests
to a Web server. That is because SPAs rely on asynchronous operations and in-memory navigation.

Herein lies the problem with SPAs. In a traditional website, when you navigate to ```/```, the web server serves up
a file associated with ```/```. Similarly, when you navigate to ```/foo```, the web server serves up a different file, now
associated with ```/foo```. However, with an SPA, ```/``` and ```/foo``` are rendered from the same file (usually the one located at ```/```).
To make things even more interesting, ```/foo``` may depend on in-memory state that was created by ```/```. So, navigating directly to
```/foo``` without originating at ```/``` can result in undesirable behavior (like an error or the page not rendering).

### React Router Basics

React Router provides an in-memory navigation facade that allows navigation between _page_ components to look like 
navigation between different web pages.

The basic setup is as follows.

#### index.js

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import {Route, Switch, BrowserRouter as Router} from "react-router-dom";

render(
      <Router>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path='/' component={RootPage} />
          <Route exact path='/foo' component={FooPage} />
          <Route component={PageNotFound} />
        </Switch>
      </Router>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

In the above configuration, index.js is the JavaScript entry point, which defines the available in-memory routes. 
The ```RootPage``` component displays when a user first navigates to the SPA. When the user clicks on a special
navigation link to ```/foo```, the path in the address bar changes to reflect ```/foo``` and the ```FooPage``` component
displays. If a user clicks on a special navigation link of anything other than ```/``` or ```/foo``` then the ```PageNotFound```
component displays.

At this point, if a user navigates directly to ```/foo``` or if she refreshes the page after having navigated to ```/foo```
from ```/```, a 404 error will be returned. This is because the navigation provided by React Router is in-memory; the Web server
doesn't know about it. However, when a user navigates directly to a page or if she refreshes a page, that triggers an HTTP request, 
which is handled by the Web server.

### Configuring The Web Server for an SPA

In order to avoid the dreaded 404 error when a user navigates directly to a route defined by React Router, the Web
server needs to be somewhat _SPA aware_. It doesn't have to be super smart, but it does have to be smart enough to know
to delegate navigation to the SPA. Basically, we want the Web server to forward all requests to the root page where
our SPA resides so that the SPA displays. We also want the path in the browser's address bar to reflect the route for the SPA to
service. This effectively delegates navigation to the SPA.

Here is such a configuration for Nginx.

```
server {
    listen       80;
    listen  [::]:80;
    server_name  localhost;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    location / {
        # <-- this bit here is what's added for push state support
        if (!-e $request_filename) {
          rewrite ^(.*)$ / break;
        }
        #  -->

        index index.html index.htm Default.htm;

    }
}
```

Dissecting the above Nginx configuration, we can see the Web server is listening on port 80, the standard unencrypted http port.
The real magic, however happens with the following configuration.

```root /usr/share/nginx/html;```

and

```
    location / {
        # <-- this bit here is what's added for push state support
        if (!-e $request_filename) {
          rewrite ^(.*)$ / break;
        }
        #  -->

        index index.html index.htm Default.htm;

    }
```

The ```root /usr/share/nginx/html;``` specifies the root where the Web server should serve files (HTML, JavaScript, images, etc.).
The configuration that starts with ```location / {``` specifies that any request under the ```/``` should serve the root
page, which is where the SPA resides. Additionally, since this only deals with how the Web server responds to requests,
the url in the browser will be whatever is requested from the user's perspective. In other words, it's not a redirect; 
it's more like a pointer.

### What About State?

As mentioned above, sometimes state loaded by one component is needed by another component. In the case where those
two components are in the same hierarchy, it's no problem: the component that loads the state passes some or all of 
that state to the second component. In that case, if the page in question is reloaded or navigated to directly then all is well.

However, in the case where a component is dependent upon state that is loaded by an adjacent component (e.g. page components) then
there must be some higher top level state to bind them together. This can be done through bubbling everything up to a top
level state that cascades its state down, or it can be done through something like Redux.

Redux is outside the scope of this post. But, it is worth mentioning some peculiarities when it comes to React state.
One of the first things React developers learn when working with React is that state changes trigger a component re-render.
To put it more simply, if a component's state changes then that component will be re-rendered.  That, however, does not hold true
for state changes that are not directly tied to rendering the component.

Let's take an example where the root page component ```/``` loads and displays user data and the ```/foo``` page component loads 
and displays transaction data based on the selected user. Now, let's say while on the ```/foo``` page, the user data state changes.
If a component on the ```/foo``` page isn't directly tied to that changed user data state, ```/foo``` will not be re-rendered.

This is called a transitive dependency. The transactions displayed on the ```/foo``` page are dependent upon the user data state.
But since the user data state is not directly tied to the rendering of transactions, changes to the user data leave the page
rendered with stale data. Or perhaps worse, what if someone navigated directly to ```/foo```, the page might error or fail
to render at all because the user data isn't present in its state, which is needed to get the transaction data that is tied
to the rendering of the component(s) on the page.

...

The solution to that particular problem, however, will have to wait for a future post on Redux.
