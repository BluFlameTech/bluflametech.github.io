DevOps is more than CI and CD; it's about empowering teams to deliver. Building software systems is hard. And although the 
practice of software engineering has come a long way since the coining of the term "DevOps," by 
Patrick Debois [over 10 years ago](https://legacy.devopsdays.org/events/2009-ghent/program), the cultural underpinnings 
it endorses to ease the burdens associated with building software systems have not always been well embraced.

It's safe to say that _we are not there yet._ In some respects, the case for DevOps has not been made - not 
sufficiently well enough for managers who came up with a compartmentalized approach to software development to adopt a 
new way of thinking, anyway. In other respects, it's just not a mature space, technologically. And the _choose your 
own adventure_ argument doesn't always play well with executive traditionalists.

### What is DevOps?

There are many definitions of DevOps floating around, but Gene Kim [The Phoenix Project, Accelerate, The Unicorn Project]
probably has the most complete definition.

> [DevOps is] The architecture, technical practices, and cultural norms that enable us toâ€¦
> increase our ability to deliver applications and services...
> quickly and safely, which enables rapid experimentation and
> innovation, and the fastest delivery of value to our customers...
> while ensuring world-class security, reliability, and stability...
> so that we can win in the marketplace.

### DevOps Automation

An easy assumption to make is that DevOps = Automation. Consider this alternative definition of DevOps from 
_[Devops: A Software Architect's Perspective](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23363016-devops)_.

> [DevOps is] a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change 
> being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality.

Clearly, automation is a significant component in that definition. Specifically, CI (Continuous Integration), which 
deals with automation that ensures the basic integrity of the code following a commit associated with integrated changes, 
and CD (Continuous Delivery), which deals with automation that ensures the system is in a working deployable state. 
But there is a lot more in between and even at the bookends when it comes to DevOps.

What about project inception - the time and effort required to initiate a project and onboard developers? What about
the maturity factor of the organization - the efficacy of the tool chain as it relates to the organization's present
capabilities? What about self-service - the technical and organizational support mechanisms that allow software systems 
to be quickly and iteratively developed as cohesive units?

### Beyond Automation

> Better Value, Sooner, Safer, Happier

\- John Smart, Deloitte

The benefits of DevOps automation cannot be understated. However, it's important to recognize that those benefits are
only realized when they support the goals of DevOps, which can be summarized as John Smart so eloquently put it: 
_better value, sooner, safer, happier._ That's not just CI and CD; and it's not just automation. It's everything 
from the culture to the tool chain to the leadership and the technical competencies that enable a holistic systems
approach to developing software systems.

> The key, then, lies not in better information, but in turning information into information that cannot be ignored.

\- [Jim Collins, Good to Great](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76865.Good_to_Great)

DevOps is a journey - a journey to empower teams to deliver better software faster, safer and more securely. And like any 
journey, support is crucial. That support comes from leadership and it comes from technology. The foundations of that 
support are rooted in evidence. And it's everyone's job to ensure that the evidence is information that cannot be ingored.
