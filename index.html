                <h3><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> SELF-SERVICE</h3>
                Call us crazy, but we don't think the solution to developer self-service is a YAP (Yet Another Portal)
                app. And yet that seems to be where many products' definition of self-service begins and ends. Enabling
                developers is crucial to effective DevOps. That means better tool integrations in the developer's
                workspace from infrastructure to application development and from inception to delivery.

                <i><a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/principles/">Computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve
                problems.</a></i><br/> Spend days/weeks/months wiring up a toolchain... check in code, spin up
                infrastructure, deploy app to infrastructure... check in code, jump to build server, initiate build, get
                feedback from build server UI... Does any of that seem familiar? It shouldn't. DevOps automation should
                "just work."

                <h3><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION</h3>
                Working in small batches, integrating code frequently and having short feedback loops has a huge positive
                impact on a teams' ability to create verifiably working code together. But what about prior to
                integration? What if you could know with certainty (and test) the status of an integration prior to
                actually integrating? We think you should, which is why we have a <i>patent pending</i> solution to do
                just that.
            </td>
            <td>
                <h3><i class="fas fa-truck"></i> CONTINUOUS DELIVERY</h3>
                Continuous Delivery strives to ensure that integrated code is in a deployable state, where it has
                been deployed, tested and validated in one or more environments, which are sufficient to ensure that
                the the "system" is in a working and deployable state. At a minimum, this is where you want to be.

            <td>
                <h3><i class="fas fa-code"></i> EVERYTHING AS CODE</h3>
                Build definitions in a database somewhere, repetitive tasks performed through a portal and lovingly
                handcrafted infrastructure are examples of what not to do. When everything is code then everything can
                be communicated, understood, tested and versioned as part of the system. No more chasing down Bob on his
                vacation to get that script buried on his laptop that's crucial to your system. Good for Bob - he gets
                to enjoy his vacation. Good for the organization - everything required to create a working system is
                maintained together.

                <h3><i class="fas fa-seedling"></i> START WITH THE BASICS &amp; GROW</h3>
                It wouldn't make a lot of sense to focus on automated deployments when
                <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration">continuous integration</a> isn't in
                place. Similarly, it wouldn't make a lot of sense to gather metrics based on competencies
                that don't exist. Table stakes: build automation w/tests tied into event-based continuous integration.
                Then, extend with automated deployments, versioning and continuous delivery using a simple workflow. Over
                time, you can grow to include a more robust workflow or multiple workflows. Think of it like a building
                - if the foundation isn't there, then it really doesn't matter how nice the rest of it is.
