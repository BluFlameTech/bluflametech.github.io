                No YAP (Yet Another Portal) app here! Everything (and we mean EVERYTHING) is available in the developer's workspace.
                From configuration to logs to build triggers, build results and more. We believe that an essential part of
                DevOps is enabling developers, which is why that guides everything we do.

                <h3><i class="fas fa-coffee"></i> SIMPLE</h3>
                Some CI/CD automation tools claim to be simple. Our <i>CodeZero</i> CI/CD automation actually is. With just a Git
                repository, many projects can be setup using a single operation in minutes. Even if you don't know how to get
                started, we've got you covered with examples and proven workflows to get your project up and running today.

                If you already have tools that you know and love, no problem! You can use them with our <i>CodeZero</i>
                CI/CD automation product. We may even have built-in integrations for them. If not, you can easily add
                your own integrations. If you don't have your own tools or if you're not sure which tools you should use,
                we've got you covered there, too.

                We can get your project bootstrapped quickly using intelligent defaults and our battle tested workflows.
                But there may come a time when you need something a little extra. That's OK, we get it. That's why nearly
                everything is extendable. From workflows to tool integrations to project archetypes and more, our
                <i>CodeZero</i> CI/CD automation product grows with you.

                source projects and it always will be. We want you to build high quality open source software
                and we think our <i>CodeZero</i> CI/CD automation product is the best product to help you do that.

                nothing you don't. Create new [working] projects, integrate with confidence, build, test, scan,
