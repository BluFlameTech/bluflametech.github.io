                    We're not talking about beating our chests with arbitrary metrics... when it comes to quality, we 
                    mean it. Quality as a practice is continuously testing our software at multiple levels, quickly 
                    integrating feedback and consistently striving to improve our product(s) and the way we work. But 
                    it's also enabling our customers to do the same. We want our software to be great. And we want your 
                    software to be great, too!

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> Fix, Don't Workaround</h3>
                    We're not perfect. Sometimes we break stuff. And when that happens, working around a problem might
                    be an easy solution, but it should never be the long-term solution. A workaround treated like a fix
                    is just a future problem waiting to happen. We work around problems when we must, but we fix them
                    as soon as we can. Because we'd rather spend most of our time creating solutions for tomorrow, not
                    climbing over problems from yesterday.

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-recycle"></i> Reuse, First</h3>
                    As tempting as it may be to reinvent technology, reuse should always be the first choice. Reuse
                    is part and parcel with research. What is the problem? Has it been solved before? Can you take 
                    advantage of the available solution(s)? Does it meet the need? Is there an existing pattern or
                    practice that addresses the problem? We reuse from each other and we reuse from the community. And 
                    like all responsible consumers, it's important to also give back for the benefit of others.

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-location-arrow"></i> Focus on Genba</h3>
                    Genba (sometimes written as Gemba) is a Japanese word meaning "the actual place." It has also been 
                    adopted as common lingo amongst Lean practitioners. By going to the actual place [where the problem 
                    occurred or where the value is created], we can focus more directly on our product(s) and on our 
                    customers. When we see what our customers see, when we experience what they experience, the BS gives 
                    way to purpose.

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-people-arrows"></i> Earn Trust</h3>
                    Our customers must trust that our product(s) are stable, reliable, available and valuable. Sure, a
                    component of that is quality. But it's more than that. It's about creating a relationship and taking
                    our responsibilities to that relationship seriously. We put earning trust at the cornerstone of our
                    business - from how we interact with our customers and our partners to how leaders interact with 
                    their teams.

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-truck"></i> Deliver</h3>
                    Good intentions, politics and slick talk mean nothing if you can't deliver a valuable product. We're
                    a software company. We deliver software. We build solutions to hard problems. That's what we do.
                    Sure, we have setbacks. But we assess, we correct, we persist and we deliver.
